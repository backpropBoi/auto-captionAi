AutoCaptionAI Privacy Policy

AutoCaptionAI captures short audio segments from videos you choose to transcribe and sends them to a secure server for speech-to-text processing. Audio is processed for the purpose of generating captions and is not stored permanently by default. All transmission uses TLS (HTTPS/WSS). If third-party services are used for transcription, their terms apply. You can disable audio capture at any time via the extension popup.
